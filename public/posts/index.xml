      <description>How did I not know this before! It was Friday. Fine day I would say, there have been worse ones but this was just fine. I had just reached my apartment, relaxed a while and turned on my playlist. A few songs went by and then it came. Rasaali (ராசாளி) meaning Falcon/Eagle (Falco Peregrinator found in the southern regions of India) , is also the title of a song in the movie Acham Yenbadu Madamaiyada.</description>
