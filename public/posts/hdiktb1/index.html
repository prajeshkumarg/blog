 <h1 id="how-did-i-not-know-this-before">How did I not know this before!</h1>
<p>It was Friday. Fine day I would say, there have been worse ones but this was just fine. I had just reached my apartment, relaxed a while and turned on my playlist. A few songs went by and then it came. Rasaali (<strong>ராசாளி)</strong> meaning Falcon/Eagle (Falco Peregrinator found in the southern regions of India) , is also the title of a song in the movie <em><code>Acham Yenbadu Madamaiyada</code></em>. I have listened to this song multiple times previously but this was the first time I realized that it had something wonderful.</p>
<p>Let’s go off the track for a bit now. Thiruppugazh (திருப்புகழ் - can be pronounced as Tiruppukal) is a very old ancient set of devotional songs dedicated to Lord Muruga by the poet-saint Arunagirinathar (அருணகிரிநாதர்). Thiruppugazh 6 Muththaiththaru (முத்தைத்தரு) is an iconic song from this set. A famous rendition of this song is by TM Sounderajan in the movie Arunagirinathar.</p>

<p>Now, let’s do a small activity. Connect your headphones and play the above music video for a few seconds (<em>approximately 9 seconds from 0:14 to 0:23</em>). Then click the below video and listen for the same 9 seconds (<em>from 2:24 to 2:33</em>).</p>

<p>And THERE IT IS!, it hits like a missile, BOOM!! The striking similarity! The music, the lyrics, everything done here by Thamarai and AR Rahman is pure genius to me. The breathtaking visuals directed - no <em>conjured</em> by GVM, the nectar like voices of Sathya Prakash and Shashaa Tirupathi - all of these together elevates not just the music but also our spirits.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>And I think this is how art evolves, passing down through various generations and inspiring artists to create art that captivates everyone. The journey of a 15th Century poem and its shades, present in a 21st Century song is just absolutely delightful.

<p>(Try singing these in alternates, it fits perfectly and syncs so well !!)</p>
<p>When we find something as interesting as this, what do we do ? SHARE. And that’s what I did.  I shared it with my friends. We all have that defunct Whatsapp group named “Trip Plan” where everything other than planning trips would be discussed. From this space I got two more ‘How did I not know this before’ - thank you Poojaa 🥂.</p>

<li>The song Avalum Naanum uses the lyrics from the poem “Avalum Naanum Amudhum Thamizhum” by the 20th CE poet Bharathidasan (பாரதிதாசன்).

<li>“Thendral Vandhu” a masterpiece by Ilayaraja inspired his son Yuvan to make the song “Idhu Varai”. The transition he does (below video) is just bliss.
