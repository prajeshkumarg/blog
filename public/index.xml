      <description>How did I not know this before! It was Friday. Fine day I would say, there have been worse ones but this was just fine.

Rasaali (ராசாளி) meaning Falcon/Eagle (Falco Peregrinator found in the southern regions of India) , is also the title of a song in the movie Acham Yenbadu Madamaiyada.</description>
